# A collection of problems we are discussing

## Problem 1
In a specified 24-hour period, a student wakes up at time T1 and goes to sleep at some later time T2. The
student always goes to sleep after he wakes up. Students do not stay up after midnight! The outcomes of
the random experiment are the pairs (T1, T2).
1. Find the sample space and sketch it on the x-y plane.
2. Consider the event A: “student is awake at 9 am.” Specify the set A and sketch it on the on the x-y
plane.
3. Consider the even B: “Student is asleep more than he is awake.” Specify the set B and sketch it on
the on the x-y plane.
4. Sketch the region corresponding to the event Ac \ B and describe the corresponding event in words.


## Problem 2
For $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n \in \mathcal{F}$, show that

$$
P\left( \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} A_i \right) \leq \sum_{i=1}^{n} P(A_i)
$$

## Probelem 3
Let $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n$ be events where $n \geq 2$, and prove that

$$
P\left( \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} A_i \right) = \sum_i P(A_i) - \sum_{i<j} P(A_i \cap A_j) + \sum_{i<j<k} P(A_i \cap A_j \cap A_k) 
 \cdots + (-1)^{n+1} P(A_1 \cap A_2 \cap \cdots \cap A_n)
$$
